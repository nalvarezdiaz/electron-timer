# electron-timer

## Installation (first time)
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dist
$ ./dist/Daily-1.0.0-x86_64.AppImage 
```
After this installation, if you accepted that the AppImage manager adds new entry in your menu, you only need to search in your menu __'Daily'__ in the __'Utilities'__ sub-menu.
